# Minimax-Connect-4

This is a simple implementation of the mini-max AI algorithm in the form of a 2 player(1v1) game called connect-4 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).
Just run the java source file and enter the depth. Depth should be a small positive integer. Large depth ( >5) would mean that the algorithm is finer but the time taken by the computer would also be high.
After entering the depth, the computer will play it's first turn. When it's your turn, enter a value between 0 and 6 ( both inclusive) because the width of the grid is 7( can be customized ).
The program exits when a player wins.
